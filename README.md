# dmi2png+

Unpacks a BYOND "DMI" file into (A)PNGs.

Improved version of https://github.com/liambaloh/DMI2PNG
for command-line use and APNG support.

## What this does

This software unpacks DMI files into individual images, one for each icon state
and direction.

Animated sprites are compiled into an APNG (animated PNG). States with multiple
directions will be placed into a folder named after the state.

If an icon state is duplicated (or missing), this script will append a number
or use "(unnamed)", respectively.

Currently, it is not possible to turn PNGs back into their component DMI files.


## Instructions

You will need command-line access, an installation of php, and some libraries
like php-gd.

Navigate to the directory containing this repository and run:

    php index.php [path to DMI file or directory]

If a directory is given, it will recursively convert DMI files in that
directory. If a single file is given, it will just convert that single file.

Example:

* test.dmi
  * human (4 directions)
  * robot (animated)

After running, it will write the following folders and files:

* test/
  * human/
    * human-dir1.png
    * human-dir2.png
    * etc.
  * robot.png 

The new folder will be in the same folder as the DMI was.
